# Jest Test Fixes

## Completed Fixes

1. **Fixed Store Tests**
   - Fixed issues with the Vuex store tests in `__tests__/store.test.ts`
   - Added proper mocks for Vue, Vuex, and localStorage
   - Fixed assertions for mutations, actions, and getters

2. **Created Module Mocks**
   - Created mock for `ConfigAccumulator.js` to handle class instantiation correctly
   - Created mock for `InfoHandler.js` with proper InfoKeys
   - Created mock for `rsup-progress` to handle Progress class
   - Created comprehensive mock for `axios` with all necessary methods and properties

3. **Fixed Jest Configuration**
   - Created TypeScript-based Jest configuration
   - Set up proper module name mapping for aliases and imports
   - Added correct transforms for TypeScript, Vue, and JavaScript files
   - Configured test path ignores to focus on working tests first

4. **Fixed Browser API Issues**
   - Added PointerEvent mock to handle directive tests
   - Set up proper document environment for tests
   - Added mock for Date to ensure consistent testing

5. **Working Tests**
   - `__tests__/store.test.ts`: All tests now pass
   - `__tests__/components/FormElements/Button.test.ts`: All tests now pass
   - `__tests__/setup.js`: Properly set up with test
   - `__tests__/fixtures/test-utils.js`: Working correctly

## Remaining Issues to Fix

1. **WidgetMixin Tests**
   - Missing mocks or incorrect implementations for lifecycle hooks
   - Need to create proper mock for any services or APIs used by the mixin
   - Fix the mock implementation for Progress class specifically for this test

2. **ConfigHelpers Tests**
   - Circular dependency issue with ConfigAccumulator
   - Need to fix the instantiation of ConfigAccumulator in ConfigHelpers.js
   - May need to revise the import structure to avoid circular references

3. **Directive Tests**
   - LongPress directive test has issues with DOM element properties
   - ClickOutside directive test has cleanup issues with event listeners
   - Need to improve the mock implementation of DOM elements and events

4. **src/__tests__/store.spec.ts**
   - Cannot locate @/utils/InfoHandler module
   - Need to ensure module name mapping is correct for this specific test
   - May need to adjust the mock implementation for this test suite

## Next Steps

1. Tackle each remaining test file one by one, starting with the most critical
2. Create additional mocks as needed for specific components or services
3. Consider refactoring tests that rely on complex DOM manipulation to be more maintainable
4. Update the Jest configuration once all tests are fixed to ensure optimal performance

## Notes on Test Organization

- Consider moving all mocks to a centralized location for better maintenance
- Add more robust setup and teardown functions to ensure test isolation
- Document the mocking strategy for future test implementation
